# PART ONE: VALIDATED UNIT ECONOMICS

## Revised Cost Structure Based on Research

### Piece Count Recommendation

**Recommended Configuration:**
- **10 "Whimsy" Shaped Pieces** - Customer-selected meaningful shapes (rose, fox, moon, etc.)
- **65-90 Standard Interlocking Pieces** - Form the background/connecting structure
- **Total: 75-100 pieces per puzzle**

**Rationale:**
- Liberty Puzzles uses ~20% whimsy pieces; 10 out of 75-100 = 10-13% (appropriately special)
- 75-100 pieces = 30-60 minute assembly time (perfect for date night or gift experience)
- Complex enough to feel substantial, simple enough not to frustrate
- Fits comfortably on 8x10" or 10x12" finished puzzle size

### Manufacturing Costs (Per Unit)

| Component | Low Estimate | Mid Estimate | High Estimate | Source/Notes |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Baltic Birch Plywood (3mm, 12x12" equivalent) | $2.00 | $3.50 | $5.00 | Amazon/MakerStock pricing, ~$3-5 per 12x20" sheet |
| Laser Cutting Time (75-100 pieces, ~15-25 min) | $5.00 | $8.00 | $12.00 | Industry rate $60-120/hr, Liberty Puzzles: 1 puzzle/hr per machine |

### Shipping Costs

| Destination | Package Weight | USPS Ground | USPS Priority | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Zone 1-4 (Regional) | 1-2 lbs | $6.50 | $9.50 | Standard puzzle |
| Zone 5-8 (Cross-country) | 1-2 lbs | $9.50 | $14.00 | Standard puzzle |
| Zone 1-4 (Regional) | 2-3 lbs | $8.00 | $12.00 | Keepsake edition |
| Zone 5-8 (Cross-country) | 2-3 lbs | $12.00 | $18.00 | Keepsake edition |
| Hawaii/Alaska | 2-3 lbs | $18.00 | $28.00 | Premium markets |
| **AVERAGE (weighted)** | | **$8.50** | **$13.00** | Based on US population distribution |

**CRITICAL NOTE:** USPS now charges $4.00 surcharge for wooden boxes (as of July 2025)

### Payment Processing

| Service | Fee Structure | On $65 Sale | On $139 Sale |
|---------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Stripe Standard | 2.9% + $0.30 | $2.19 | $4.33 |
| Stripe with Int'l Card | 2.9% + 1.5% + $0.30 | $3.16 | $6.41 |
| **Average (assume 10% int'l)** | | **$2.29** | **$4.54** |

### Complete Unit Economics Summary

**BASE PUZZLE ($65) - Colored Wood, Standard Box, 75-100 pieces**

| Category | Mid Estimate |
|----------|--------------|
| Puzzle Manufacturing | $17.50 |
| Standard Packaging | $5.00 |
| Shipping (absorbed) | $8.50 |
| Payment Processing | $2.29 |
| **Total COGS** | **$33.29** |
| **Gross Margin** | **$31.71 (48.8%)** |

**KEEPSAKE EDITION ($139) - Colored Wood, 75-100 pieces**

| Category | Mid Estimate |
|----------|--------------|
| Puzzle Manufacturing | $17.50 |
| Keepsake Packaging | $27.00 |
| Shipping (absorbed) | $10.00 |
| Payment Processing | $4.54 |
| **Total COGS** | **$59.04** |
| **Gross Margin** | **$79.96 (57.5%)** |

**VERDICT:** Unit economics are tighter than originally estimated. Base product at ~49% gross margin is viable but leaves little room for CAC. Keepsake Edition at 57.5% margin is essential for profitability. Consider whether $65 should increase to $75 or reduce piece count to 50-75 total.

## Customer Acquisition Cost Reality

### Facebook/Instagram Ads Benchmarks (2025 Data)

| Metric | Industry Average | "Shopping/Gifts" Category | Implications |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| CPC (Cost Per Click) | $0.70 | $0.38 (down 46% YoY) | Favorable for personalized gifts |
| CTR (Click Through Rate) | 1.51% | 2.48% (up 146% YoY) | High engagement potential |
| Conversion Rate (e-comm) | 1.5-3% | 2-4% | Assume conservative 2% |
| **Implied CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)** | | **$19-38** | At 2% CVR from click |

### Realistic CAC Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- $0.50 CPC (optimistic for gift category)
- 2% landing page to checkout conversion
- 50% checkout completion rate
- **Overall funnel conversion: 1%**

**CAC = $0.50 / 1% = $50 per customer**

### Break-Even Analysis

| Scenario | Gross Margin | CAC | Contribution Margin | Orders to Break Even* |
|----------|--------------|-----|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Base ($65), CAC $50 | $37.21 | $50 | -$12.79 | UNPROFITABLE |
| Base ($65), CAC $35 | $37.21 | $35 | $2.21 | 2,262 orders |
| Keepsake ($139), CAC $50 | $85.46 | $50 | $35.46 | 141 orders |
| Mixed (60% Keepsake), CAC $45 | $66.16 avg | $45 | $21.16 | 237 orders |

*To cover $5,000 bootstrap budget

**KEY INSIGHT:** The business only works if Keepsake Edition uptake exceeds 50% or CAC drops below $35.

# PART TWO: MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGY

## Recommended Production Approach

### Phase 1: Manual/Artisan (0-50 orders/month)

**Equipment Needed:**
- Desktop CO2 Laser Cutter (60-80W): $3,000-5,000 (xTool, Glowforge, OMTech)
- Alternatively: Partner with local makerspace ($20-40/hr machine time)

**Process:**
1. Receive order via Typeform/manual checkout
2. Generate vector cut files from shape library (pre-built SVGs)
3. Cut 3mm Baltic Birch plywood (12x12" sheets, ~$3 each)
4. Apply wood stain by hand (water-based, non-toxic)
5. Quality control: sand edges, inspect fit
6. Package in kraft box
7. Ship via USPS Ground Advantage

**Time per unit:** 45-60 minutes (including setup)
**Maximum capacity:** 3-4 per day (solo operation)

### Phase 2: Small Batch (50-200 orders/month)

**Equipment Additions:**
- Second laser cutter OR larger format (100W+)
- Batch staining station
- Dedicated workspace (~200 sq ft)

**Process Improvements:**
- Batch cutting: nest multiple puzzles per sheet
- Jig system for consistent piece placement
- Batch staining with drying racks
- Printed packaging labels
- Shipping software (ShipStation, Stamps.com)

**Time per unit:** 25-35 minutes
**Maximum capacity:** 15-20 per day (with 1 helper)

### Phase 3: Outsourced Production (200+ orders/month)

**Options Researched:**

| Supplier Type | Location | MOQ | Lead Time | Est. Cost/Unit | Quality |
|---------------|----------|-----|-----------|----------------|---------|
| China Manufacturer (Talmud, etc.) | Guangdong/Zhejiang | 500-1000 | 4-6 weeks | $4-8 | Variable |
| Liberty Puzzles (white-label inquiry) | Boulder, CO | Unknown | 2-3 weeks | $30-50 | Premium |
| Local Laser Shop | US-based | 25-50 | 1-2 weeks | $10-20 | Good |
| Etsy Maker Partnership | Distributed | 10-20 | 1-2 weeks | $15-25 | Variable |

**Recommended Path:** Start with local laser shops for prototype production, transition to dedicated US-based manufacturer at 200+ orders/month.

### Materials Specification

**Optimal Wood Choice:**
- **Material:** Baltic Birch Plywood, B/BB grade
- **Thickness:** 3mm (1/8") - standard for puzzles
- **Sheet Size:** 12x12" or 12x20" for nesting efficiency
- **Cost:** $2.50-4.00 per sheet (20 puzzles from 12x20" sheet = $0.15/puzzle material)

**Stain/Color Options:**
- Water-based wood stains (non-toxic)
- Colors: Natural, Honey Oak, Walnut, Ebony, Gray Wash, White Wash
- Drying time: 2-4 hours
- Cost: $0.50-1.00 per puzzle in stain materials

**Why NO Photo Initially:**
- UV printing on wood requires $15,000+ equipment OR expensive outsourcing ($5-10/unit)
- Photo quality inconsistency on wood grain
- Customer expectation management challenges
- Added 3-5 days to production cycle

# APPENDIX: COMPETITOR PRICING REFERENCE

| Competitor | Product | Price | Pieces | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Liberty Puzzles | Custom 500pc | $100+ | 500 | Premium wooden, 2-3 week lead |
| Shutterfly | Photo Puzzle | $35-45 | 500-1000 | Cardboard, commodity |
| CreateJigsawPuzzles | Custom Wood 100pc | $63.50 | 100 | Laser cut, standard shapes |
| Etsy Sellers | Custom Wood 50-200pc | $30-80 | Variable | Inconsistent quality |
| **Interlock** | **Custom 10pc shaped** | **$65** | **10** | **Unique shapes, meaning** |

## Your Positioning Validated

You are positioned ABOVE commodity (Shutterfly) and BELOW premium collectors (Liberty Puzzles), in a unique "sentimental gift" space. The format (75-100 pieces with 10 custom whimsy shapes) is differentiated enough that direct price comparison is difficult, which actually helps justify the $65 price point.
